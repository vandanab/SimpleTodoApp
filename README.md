# SimpleTodoApp Demo

(Codepath Bootcamp Prework: SimpleTodoApp)

SimpleTodo is an Android application which allows users to maintain a list of their todo items.
A user can add, edit, delete items from the list.

Time spent: 10 hours.

Completed user stories:

 * [x] Required: User can view a list of todo items.
 * [x] Required: User can add a new todo item.
 * [x] Required: User can remove a todo item by long tapping on the item.
 * [x] Required: User can edit a todo item in a separate activity by tapping on the item.
 * [x] Optional: User is notified after editing an item.
 * [x] Optional: User can clear all items in the todo list by clicking the delete icon on the action bar of todo activity.
 * [x] Optional: The items list is persisted in the sqlite database and accessed using a custom content provider.
 
Notes:

Spent quite some time trying to figure out how to use content providers, write a custom provider, add an action bar menu item, using loader callbacks, etc.

The master branch has the basic app and the sqliteandclear branch has the optional features added.
